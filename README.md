`mesh2tikz` is a library to convert meshes of the [tcode](https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code) library into `tikz` format. It takes a mesh, a camera-position and a view-volume as an input and transfers the elements of the mesh that lay in the view-volume into a `.tikz` file. 

# The purpose of the library
[tcode](https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code) is known for its parallel capabilities and its support for extremely large meshes. At first, it seems to be unpractical to transfrom a mesh into a `tikz`-file. 
This library is meant to support you to visualize concepts used in t8code for any of your publications. As [tcode](https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code) keeps on evolving and new features are published this library can visualize these additions on smaller meshes. 

# How to setup?
Before starting, you should ensure that t8code, [p4est](https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est) and [sc](https://github.com/cburstedde/libsc) are installed. p4est and sc should come with an installation of t8code. The installation of `mesh2tikz` is very similar to [png2mesh](https://github.com/DLR-AMR/png2mesh) and if you have already installed it, you can probably skip the setup of the enviroment variables. If not, the following enviroment variables must be set:
- `T8_INCLUDE`, the include directory of t8code, p4est and sc
- `T8_LIB`, the directory containing the libraries of t8code, p4est and sc.

The following steps will build 'mesh2tikz' on a linux enviroment:
1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`
